## Dashboard

[Feijoa Dashboard](https://app.feijoa.dev)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save feijoa-react
```

## Usage

### Component

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Feature } from "@feijoa/react";

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Feature enabled={true}>
        <MyFeature />
      <Feature>
    )
  }
}
```

### Hook

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { useFeature } from "@feijoa/react";

const Example = () => {
  const showFeature = useFeature({
    enabled: true
  });

  return (
    showFeature ? <MyFeature /> : null
  );
}
```

## Setup

Feijoa offers a centralised dashboard for managing features. As shown in the examples above, this is not essential for using this library but the advantages are discussed below.

## Problem

Feature flags are a great way to manage your feature release. They make it super easy to enable or disable your feature with the flick of a switch. However, as your application grows and you get more and more features and more and more developers on the team, it becomes a lot harder trying to manage all your feature flags. 

Flags become obsolete, meaning your feature has been fully released but you still have relics of flags in your environment variables. 

You also need to make sure your other team members have access to the list of feature flags in their environment variables since they are typically not version controlled. 

Furthermore, in order to toggle the value of a feature flag, you often need to do a release if your flag is in your source code or force your app / server to restart so that it picks up your new environment variable value. 

## Solution

Feijoa tries to simplify feature flag management by providing a centralised dashboard to manage all these features. Flags can be toggled in real time allowing anybody to enable a feature when they are ready or even immediately disable it if they notice a bug. Sometimes a dashboard can be overkill so Feijoa still offers the ability to manage flags with booleans or environment variables to make things easy to get up and running.

## Environment Variables

*NOTE: All env vars can be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for use with create-react-app*
